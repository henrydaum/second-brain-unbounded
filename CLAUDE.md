# ⚡ THE KERNEL (READ FIRST)

Second Brain is a **microkernel**: a minimal, reliable core that boots, runs
the conversation loop + agent turn, persists conversations, and loads/unloads
plugins. Product capabilities arrive through a **package store** (the
agentskills.io model: a registry you browse, install, and uninstall from).
Do not bake heavy features into the kernel; they belong in packages.

> Goal in priority order: (1) the kernel works **flawlessly and reliably**, then
> (2) build install/uninstall against a cloud store, then (3) versioning and
> possibly containerization. We are at the end of step (1).

## What ships in the kernel (`plugins/`)

Plugins are discovered purely by file presence (`plugins/plugin_discovery.py`).
The kernel was produced by **moving** non-essential plugins into `store/` (a
staging catalog that mirrors `plugins/`, preserved via `git mv` to seed the
future store) — *not* by deleting them. What remains:

- **Services:** `service_llm`, `service_compactor` (context-safety),
  `service_parser` (text + image helper discovery), `service_timekeeper`
  (lightweight event clock), and `service_plugin_watcher` (hot-reload = the
  install/uninstall substrate). If another tracked service remains, treat it as
  kernel-boundary debt unless the user explicitly keeps it.
- **Tasks:** none.
- **Tools:** none in the tracked kernel tree. `tool_read_file`,
  `tool_ask_user_question`, shell/file-editing tools, SQL tools, and plugin
  authoring tools are package capabilities unless discovery shows they are
  installed.
- **Frontend:** `frontend_repl` only. Telegram and the MCP server
  (`frontend_mcp_server` — exposes Second Brain to external MCP clients over
  streamable HTTP; tested from main via `tests/test_frontend_mcp.py`, which
  loads it off the store ref) live on the store branch. `enabled_frontends`
  is deliberately not whitelisted by the kernel: config normalization keeps
  unknown names so installed store frontends survive load, and bootstrap
  warns/skips what discovery can't resolve.
- **Commands:** REPL UX + introspection only — `config`, `setup` (LLM onboarding
  wizard), `llm`, `conversations`, `clear`, `cancel`, `debug`, `frontends`,
  `locations`, `commands`, `tools`, `services`, `tasks`, `packages`.
  Profile/scheduling/MCP/update commands are package capabilities unless the
  tracked tree still carries a transitional command.

The pipeline substrate (`pipeline/` — orchestrator, watcher, event_trigger) still
boots, but ships **zero pipeline tasks**: it idles until a pipeline plugin
(extract/chunk/index/embed) is installed.

**Parsers.** The kernel keeps only the dependency-light `parse_text` parser
(UTF-8 / code / CSV / TSV, stdlib). Shared text helpers live in
`parsing_utils.py`. The registry (`parser_registry.py`) carries a static
native-modality default map so `get_modality` resolves image/audio/video even
with no parser installed (attachment routing relies on this). Every heavier
parser is an installable store package (`parser-pdf`, `parser-office`,
`parser-tabular`, `parser-image`, `parser-audio`, `parser-video`, `parser-gdoc`,
`parser-container`) that ships a `services/helpers/parse_*.py` file —
**not** a plugin entrypoint. `ParserService._load()` rebuilds the registry by
discovery-scanning `services/helpers/parse_*.py` across the built-in, sandbox,
and installed roots, so installed parsers light up on load; `package_manager`
reloads the parser service on install/uninstall of any such file so it takes
effect live. The attachment system is unified onto this one registry:
`attachments/parse.py` builds an `Attachment` via `parser.get_modality` +
`parser.parse(path, "text")` (no separate attachment-parser registry).

## The kernel boundary (the one rule)

Core code (`pipeline/`, `runtime/`, `state_machine/`, `agent/`, `events/`,
`config/`, `attachments/`, `main.pyw`) hard-imports **exactly two** plugin
modules. Keep these two resolvable in any kernel:
1. `service_llm` — `runtime/conversation_loop.py`.
2. `parser_registry` — `pipeline/orchestrator.py`, `pipeline/watcher.py`.

This rule is executable: `tests/test_kernel_boundary.py` AST-walks every core
module and pins the complete set of `plugins.*` import edges (the plugin
substrate plus the two implementations above, including lazy function-local
imports). Widening the boundary fails the suite until the test's allowlist —
and this section — are updated deliberately.

Everything else is discovery-based. The agent system prompt collects optional
guidance from each in-scope plugin's `agent_prompt_for(ctx)` (see `_collect` in
`agent/system_prompt.py`), so missing plugins degrade silently and correctly —
uninstalling a package removes its prompt text with it.

## Hardening applied for kernel reliability

These edits exist so the kernel degrades cleanly when a stdlib plugin is absent —
the difference between a microkernel and a pile of assumptions:
- **`plugins/services/service_compactor.py`** — context compaction is a
  synchronous service call from the conversation loop, so the kernel does not
  route a blocking request through the event task queue. Its trigger lives in
  the loop's own **compaction layer** (`_compaction_layer`), a kernel escort
  always stacked inside registered `model_call` escorts (onion: registered
  escorts → context guard → empty-response nudge → backend) — context safety
  is hook-shaped but never registry-dependent. Reactive overflow retries
  rebuild the prompt from compacted history and re-enter the inner onion, so
  they keep the post-escort brain, bus events, and provider params.
- **`runtime/runtime_config.py` `build_loop`** — the "no LLM" path now raises a
  friendly message pointing at `/setup` instead of an opaque error.
- **`config/config_data.py`** — `autoload_services` trimmed to
  `["llm", "timekeeper"]` (extension services auto-load when installed);
  `enabled_frontends` → `["repl"]`;
  `DEFAULT_SCHEDULED_JOBS` → `{}` (no default jobs; `service_timekeeper` ships
  in the kernel tree, and scheduled-job *consumers* are store plugins).
- **`requirements.txt`** — kernel-minimal. Optional parser, scheduling-consumer,
  frontend, LLM backend, search, and integration dependencies belong to package
  metadata. If `requirements.txt` grows, check whether the dependency is truly
  kernel infrastructure.

## The action ledger

The kernel's flight recorder: an append-only `action_ledger` table
(`pipeline/database.py`) recording **every action the system takes**, so
unattended operation is auditable and anything is reconstructable after the
fact. Three origins:

- `user_enact` — written at the labeled enact site in
  `ConversationRuntime._dispatch`.
- `agent_enact` — written by `ConversationLoop._enact_logged`, the gateway
  all agent-side enacts flow through (tool calls, send_text, end_turn,
  over-budget summaries).
- `system` — acts outside the state machine: package install/uninstall
  (with provenance: store commit + per-file SHA-256, recorded by
  `package_manager` — the seed of future versioning), `config_save`
  (changed key **names** only, never values), and conversation lifecycle
  ops including **refused** cross-user attempts (`ok=0, access_denied`).

Failure policy: ledger writes are best-effort at every layer
(`db.record_action` swallows + logs; `runtime/ledger.py` helpers tolerate
missing/stubbed dbs) — the ledger observes the system and must never break
it. Rows are capped (`LEDGER_JSON_CAP`, truncation wrapper stays valid
JSON); no FKs on purpose so audit rows outlive what they describe.

Retention is the **single** `data_retention_days` setting (0 = keep
forever): `Database.prune_expired` deletes everything that accumulates
without bound — ledger rows, idle conversations (messages cascade; any new
message resets a conversation's clock), finished `task_runs` — once at
bootstrap plus a cheap ledger-only sweep on writes. The prune itself is
ledger-recorded. Don't add per-table retention knobs; fold new unbounded
tables into this one.

The ledger is write-optimized filler by volume — read it *targeted*
(by conversation_id / session_key / origin), never linearly; agent-facing
guidance lives in the store `sb-troubleshooting` skill, not the kernel
prompt. The stress oracle checks recent-row well-formedness
(`_check_ledger` in `stress/invariants.py`); tests in
`tests/test_ledger.py`. Query/inspection UX (`/ledger`) is deliberately a
future store package, not kernel.

## Package store V1

- **Tree mirror, not package archives.** The `origin/store` branch mirrors what
  `DATA_DIR/installed_plugins` would look like if every optional plugin/helper
  were installed: `tools/tool_*.py`, `services/service_*.py`,
  `frontends/frontend_*.py`, `commands/command_*.py`, `tasks/task_*.py`, plus
  family-local `helpers/` files. `/packages install <stem>` and
  `/packages uninstall <stem>` target the file stem (`frontend_telegram`,
  `parse_pdf`, `bundle_starter`, etc.).
- **Dependency metadata lives in code.** Plugin base classes expose
  `dependencies_files` and `dependencies_pip`; helpers use the same names as
  module-level literal lists. The package manager reads these fields with AST
  parsing, never by importing store files.
- **Install is a tree copy.** `/packages` reads the target file from
  `origin/store`, recursively follows `dependencies_files`, runs `pip install`
  for collected `dependencies_pip`, and copies the same relative paths into
  `DATA_DIR/installed_plugins`. The store copy always wins: a differing
  existing file is overwritten in place (no versioning yet — the store branch
  is assumed to hold the newest version); byte-identical files are skipped.
- **Uninstall scans live trees.** Uninstall follows the installed target's
  dependency metadata, scans built-in, sandbox, and installed plugin trees, and
  removes only candidate files/pip packages no remaining file still declares.
  Kernel requirements are never pip-uninstalled. Bundles are cloud-only
  manifests in `origin/store` that list store-relative files and feed the same
  resolver. Config cleanup, SQL table cleanup, and versioning are deferred.

## Verifying the kernel

Discovery/boot smoke (no frontend, no config writes):
```bash
python -c "from pathlib import Path; _R=Path.cwd(); \
from config import config_manager; from pipeline.database import Database; \
from pipeline.orchestrator import Orchestrator; from agent.tool_registry import ToolRegistry; \
from plugins.plugin_discovery import discover_services, discover_tasks, discover_tools; \
c=config_manager.load(); db=Database(c['db_path']); s=discover_services(_R,c); \
o=Orchestrator(db,c,s); discover_tasks(_R,o,c); t=ToolRegistry(db,c,s); t.orchestrator=o; \
discover_tools(_R,t,c); print(sorted(s), sorted(o.tasks), sorted(t.tools))"
```
For a hermetic smoke, point DATA_DIR at an empty temporary location first;
otherwise local installed packages will appear in discovery and hide kernel
boundary drift. Expect kernel services, no tasks, and no built-in tools. Then
`python main.py`, run `/setup` to install/configure starter capability, and
confirm a REPL round-trip + clean compaction on a long conversation.

## Recent work — state machine unification

The conversation layer was unified around a single state machine
(`ConversationState` in [state_machine/conversation.py](state_machine/conversation.py))
driven by [runtime/conversation_runtime.py](runtime/conversation_runtime.py)
(`ConversationRuntime`). Every frontend action — REPL, installed Telegram, future
background drivers — flows through one labeled `cs.enact(...)` site in
`_dispatch`, mirroring PokerMonster's `run_game`. Agent turns hand off to
`ConversationLoop.drive()`, which has its own labeled enact site for the
agent's moves.

The same primitives now back commands and tools: a `CallableSpec` has a
handler, an optional form (list of `FormStep`), and an optional
`form_factory(args, cs)` for dynamic forms. Forms suspend into a `PhaseFrame` on
the cache stack, surviving restarts via the persistence layer
([runtime/persistence.py](runtime/persistence.py)).

The runtime exposes `runtime.active_session_key` / `active_conversation_id`
so background drivers can identify themselves: anything with a session key
that doesn't match the active one is, by definition, running unattended.
The tool registry uses this to refuse `background_safe=False` tools from
non-active sessions. The scheduled-subagent layer was rebuilt on these
primitives and ships as the store Scheduling bundle (`command_schedule`,
`task_spawn_subagent`, `tool_schedule_subagent`): timekeeper jobs emit a
bus event, the spawn task opens its own `spawn_subagent:<cid>` session and
drives `runtime.iterate_agent_turn(...)`. There is no `is_subagent` flag in
the runtime — a subagent is just a session whose key isn't the active one.

"Is a human present at this session right now?" is asked in exactly three
places (interactive-tool gating, the notify-prompt block, background
notification push) via one reader: `runtime.is_attended(session_key)`. By
default this is just `session_key == active_session_key` (the single-active
rule), but a frontend can override it per session — `RuntimeSession.attended`
(`bool | None`, ephemeral, not persisted), set through
`runtime.set_session_attended` or the `BaseFrontend.mark_attended` /
`mark_unattended` helpers. This is the kernel's hook for **concurrent
multi-user frontends** (e.g. a website marking a session attended on socket
connect, unattended on disconnect): the kernel only *reads* attendance, the
frontend *owns* the policy. Single-user frontends (REPL, installed Telegram) set
nothing and keep `attended=None`, inheriting the global behavior unchanged.

### The user dimension

Sessions also carry an **ephemeral, frontend-bound `user_id`** ("whose data is
this?"), seeded fallback `DEFAULT_USER_ID = 1` (the base user). **Identity
(`user_id`) and authorization (`frontend_profile`) are separate axes** — there is
no privileged "admin" user; the REPL is powerful because its *frontend_profile* is
unrestricted, not because of its user. A frontend **declares** how sessions map to
users via `BaseFrontend.user_binding` (`"single"` ⇒ every session is
`default_user_id`; `"per_user"` ⇒ each identity its own user) + `default_user_id`;
the base auto-binds unbound sessions to that default, and `per_user` frontends call
`bind_session(key, external_id)` / `identify(...)` to upgrade on login. Login itself
is a frontend concern (the kernel ships no crypto — it stores `password_hash`
opaquely). `session.user_id` is **not** persisted
in the marker: ownership lives on `conversations.user_id` (the source of truth), so
identity can never leak in by loading a conversation. Per-user data is the `users`
table (`user_type` label + `config` JSON blob + `username`/`password_hash` columns),
reached anywhere via `context.user_id` / `context.current_user()` / `context.db`.
`user_type` is frontend-defined metadata (guest/admin/paid/creator/etc.), not a
kernel admin bypass; frontends and policy plugins decide what it means. Plugins declare
**user-scoped settings** with `{"scope": "user"}` in a setting's `type_info`; `/config`
reads/writes those against the current user's `config` blob instead of the global
config. The remembered `last_active_conversation_id` also lives in the current
user's config blob, so startup restore is per-user rather than one public/global
pointer. `active_agent_profile` and `skip_permissions` are user-scoped too:
profile definitions remain global, but the user's selected profile and trusted
tool list live with that user. **Conversation ownership is enforced** by `runtime.assert_conversation_access`
on every load/mutate-by-id path (`load_history`, `load_conversation`, `open_session`,
`inject_user_message(..., conversation_id=...)`, `delete_conversation`, `set_conversation_category`,
`set_conversation_notification_mode`) — listing filters are convenience only;
`override=True` (or using the raw `db.*` methods) is the system path.

## Command lifecycle (current)

A command emits two events: `COMMAND_CALL_STARTED` (first invocation, even if
a form will be filled afterward) and `COMMAND_CALL_FINISHED` (after the
handler runs, or on cancel during a form). Same `call_id` across the
lifecycle — pinned to the form's `PhaseFrame.data["call_id"]` so STARTED
and FINISHED match up. See
[state_machine/action.py](state_machine/action.py)
`_CallableAction.execute` and `_run`.

`BaseFrontend` ([plugins/BaseFrontend.py](plugins/BaseFrontend.py)) subscribes
both events and routes them through `render_tool_status(session_key,
payload)`. Rich frontends such as installed Telegram can edit a single status
message in place; the REPL prints the same shapes to stdout.

## Presentation convention: markdown on the wire

Command/tool output is a **string of GitHub-flavored markdown**, built with
the primitives in
[plugins/frontends/helpers/formatters.py](plugins/frontends/helpers/formatters.py):
`md_table` for data tables, `detail_card(title, pairs)` for describe-style
key/value cards, `quote_block` for prose under a card (descriptions,
previews, payloads), and fenced code blocks for multi-line technical dumps
(/debug, /locations — rich renderers collapse single newlines in prose).
Tables must start their own block (blank line before), or GFM parsers fold
them into the preceding paragraph. Each frontend then renders by policy, not
by sender: the REPL runs `render_plain` (aligns tables, strips fence
markers); Telegram's rich path renders markdown natively but compacts
detail-card-shaped tables into code blocks, and its HTML fallback renders
tables/quotes as `<pre>`/`<blockquote>`. Don't invent a structured message
type for this — markdown is deliberately the interchange format (it is also
what the LLM emits, so frontends need exactly one rendering path).

`BaseFrontend` also exposes optional per-frontend polish hooks:
`render_queued_ack` (suppress the textual mid-turn ack in favor of e.g. a
message reaction) and `render_conversation_banner` (mirror the session's
conversation title on a persistent surface; fed by the
`SESSION_CONVERSATION_CHANGED` bus channel).

## Where to plug in

- **Add a slash command**: write a `BaseCommand` subclass as `command_*.py` in
  the sandbox, installed package tree, or deliberately in [plugins/commands/](plugins/commands/)
  when it is true kernel behavior. Commands receive `SecondBrainContext` in both
  `form(args, context)` and `run(args, context)`.
- **Add a tool**: write a `BaseTool` subclass as `tool_*.py` in the sandbox,
  installed package tree, or deliberately in [plugins/tools/](plugins/tools/)
  when it is true kernel behavior. Tools receive `SecondBrainContext` from
  [runtime/context.py](runtime/context.py).
- **Bend a per-turn kernel decision**: register a hook from a service's
  `bind_runtime`/`_load` via `runtime.hooks.add(moment, fn)`
  ([runtime/hooks.py](runtime/hooks.py), worked examples in
  [templates/hook_template.py](templates/hook_template.py)). The agent turn
  is a fixed ritual with a doorway at every moment, and nothing influences a
  turn except through a doorway. Six moments, one contract (`fn(ctx,
  payload)`; return `None` to abstain; raising hooks are logged and skipped):
  `turn_start` (adjuster — pre-drive injection: prompt extras, staged
  attachments, queued actions; skipped on restart re-drives; keep fast),
  `shape_scope` (adjuster — inject/hide tools per session), `vet_permission`
  (verdict — allow/deny sensitive calls; asked at two stages, `"approval"`
  for sensitive commands and `"unattended_call"` for interactive tools in
  unattended sessions, where the kernel's default on abstain is to refuse), `model_call` (**escort** —
  `fn(ctx, request, proceed)` owns the round trip to the model: rewrite the
  `ModelRequest` (swap `request.llm`, edit messages, set `tool_choice` on
  backends with `supports_tool_choice`), place the call, inspect the
  response, retry — subsumes the old LLM-selector mechanism and the old
  restart-to-swap-brains dance), `end_turn` (verdict — the doorman at the
  exit: `Allow` / `SendBack(note)` / `RequireTool(name)` / `Redrive()`,
  hard-capped at `DOORMAN_FIRE_LIMIT` interventions per turn so a doorman
  can never trap the agent; the kernel's over-budget wrap-up is itself the
  default doorman at `reason == "budget_exhausted"`), and `turn_finish`
  (observer — fires once per logical turn with a `TurnOutcome`). Hooks can
  also queue tool calls onto `session.pending_agent_actions` (drained at
  loop boundaries through the normal enact/ledger path).
  `session.restart_turn = True` remains the mid-turn spelling of `Redrive()`
  for tools. Hooks run in registration order (= plugin load order); a
  priority knob is deliberately deferred until two plugins actually conflict. Every agent enact ledger row records the driving model in
  `data_json.llm` (post-escort) and doorway-forced acts carry
  `data_json.hook`.
- **Ship a task with a schedule**: declare `default_jobs` on the task
  (`{job_name: {"channel", "cron", "payload"}}`). The orchestrator seeds the
  Timekeeper job at registration if absent (disabled jobs count as existing)
  and removes it at unregistration, so default jobs live exactly as long as
  their task and a reinstall picks up an updated declaration. Disabling —
  not deleting — is the durable way to silence a default job.
- **Observe finished turns** (learn-from-outcome loops, memory writers):
  subscribe to `SESSION_TURN_COMPLETED` — emitted once per logical turn from
  the drive site, foreground and background alike, with `ok`/`cancelled`/
  `user_id`/`final_text`/`new_messages` (restart re-drives don't emit; crashes
  emit with `ok: False`). Bus handlers run on the drive thread, so heavy
  consumers should be pipeline tasks with `trigger="event"` on the channel —
  the event trigger queues a `task_runs` row and the orchestrator does the
  work off-thread.
- **Drive an agent from a task**: call `context.runtime.iterate_agent_turn(...)`
  on a session key. The runtime persists history and markers atomically
  for you. Background drivers should keep their session key distinct from
  the active one so the registry's `background_safe` gate kicks in.
- **Let an agent run a slash command**: use an installed command/tool bridge if
  one is present in the current tool catalog. The kernel should not hardcode
  command-running tools for packages it may not ship.

## Command plugins

Slash commands now mirror the rest of the plugin system. The repo starts with a
clean command slate: add built-ins as `command_*.py` files under
[plugins/commands/](plugins/commands/), or create sandbox commands under
`DATA_DIR/sandbox_plugins/commands`. The registry in
[plugins/frontends/helpers/command_registry.py](plugins/frontends/helpers/command_registry.py)
is only the adapter: it builds context-aware forms, parses one-shot `/cmd ...`
input mechanically, and dispatches structured dict args.

## Sandbox plugin system

The agent can author tools/tasks/services/commands/frontends into
`DATA_DIR/sandbox_plugins/<family>/` when an editing/package-authoring tool is
installed and in scope. Shell and file-editing tools are not kernel guarantees.
Sandbox and installed plugins are auto-discovered alongside first-party ones in
[plugins/](plugins/). Plugin helpers should use relative imports so files can
move between built-in, sandbox, and installed trees.

## Files that matter most

- [runtime/context.py](runtime/context.py) — `SecondBrainContext`, the
  shared bag tools/tasks receive.
- [runtime/conversation_runtime.py](runtime/conversation_runtime.py) —
  `ConversationRuntime`, the single dispatcher. This is the accepted "ugly
  duckling" of the codebase.
- [state_machine/action.py](state_machine/action.py) — every
  user/agent action type lives here; one class per action.
- [pipeline/orchestrator.py](pipeline/orchestrator.py) — task scheduling and
  the dependency-pipeline DAG. `runtime` is wired in
  [runtime/bootstrap.py](runtime/bootstrap.py).
- [agent/system_prompt.py](agent/system_prompt.py) — single entry point for
  building the agent system prompt; gates sections by which tools the
  current scope exposes.

"""
Kernel event channel registry.

Declaring channels in one place is the discipline that keeps the event bus
from becoming a dumping ground. If adding a channel feels like it needs
justification, that's the point — use the bus only when the producer and
consumer are architecturally far apart. For anything tightly coupled or on
the hot path, call the function directly.

**Scope: this file documents channels the *kernel* produces or consumes.**
The bus itself needs no registration (a channel is just a string), so a plugin
owns its own channels — it defines the constant + payload doc at the top of its
module (relative-imported by siblings in the same family) and emits/subscribes
there. A plugin channel must NOT be declared here, even speculatively: the
kernel must not carry contracts for code it doesn't contain (uninstall the
plugin and its channel should vanish with it). Kernel-produced channels may, of
course, be *subscribed to* by plugins — that's the whole point of emitting them
unconditionally.

Payload shapes are documented here, not enforced at runtime.

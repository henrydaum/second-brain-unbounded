"""Per-conversation runtime state.

Two dataclasses live here, kept apart from the runtime so each can be read
on its own:

- :class:`RuntimeSession` is the in-memory bag of *everything* the runtime
  needs to reason about a single conversation: the state machine, the
  provider-shaped history list, persistence id, profile pinning, plugin-
  pinned tools, the per-session lock, and the cancel event.
- :class:`RuntimeResult` is the transport-neutral output the runtime hands
  back to a frontend after every action.

"""Escalation extension: a cheap-model cascade.

Any session whose effective LLM is *not* the configured strong model gets an
``escalate`` tool. Calling it ends the current drive, and the runtime
immediately re-drives the turn on the strong model (the kernel's
``session.restart_turn`` primitive + a ``model_call`` escort that retargets
every call of the re-driven turn). The weak model's partial turn — including
the escalate call and its reason — stays in history, so the strong model sees
what was attempted. Escalation lasts one turn: the next user message resolves
the session's normal model again.

Only the strong model's profile name is configured; every other model is
implicitly "weak". The strong model itself never sees the tool, so it can
never escalate.

"""Subagents runtime extension — the end-of-turn barrier for spawn_agent.

When a session has background children pending (spawn_agent wait=false), an
``end_turn`` doorman holds the turn open until each child finishes or is
cancelled at its deadline — the timeout is a hard cutoff, never a silent
drop, so the model always learns each child's fate. Completion and timeout
notices land in the session's message queue (completions written by
task_spawn_subagent, timeouts by the barrier itself), and the doorman answers
``Redrive()`` so the model sees them before the logical turn ends — never
one turn too late. Because the doorman stands at the exit *before* the
end_turn enact, the agent keeps priority for the whole wait.
